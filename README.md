ToDo:



MVP:

- The player should die if:
	- they leave the screen
	- they are hit by a car
	- they fall in the water (frogs can drown, apparently)
	- they are eaten by a wild animal
- If the player reaches a lillypad on the top of the screen, the lillypad will be “full.”
	When all five lillypads are full, the level is complete.
- Add a UI with a life counter and a score counter.
- Create an animation or use a particle effect to make the frog’s death extra juicy!


Future Stuff:
